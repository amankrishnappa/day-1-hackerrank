Objective
In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

Task
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

        // Calculate the tax amount
        double tax = meal_cost * tax_percent / 100;

        // Calculate the total cost
        double total_cost = meal_cost + tip + tax;

        // Round the total cost to the nearest integer and print it
        System.out.println(Math.round(total_cost));
